     * INTRO
     * -----
     * We're building a piece of software that helps people better understand their finances. Let's call it Bankin'. ;)
     * Here is our plan:
     *  - let any user knows how much money they spend on each category
     *  - let any user sets budgets to help them save money
     *
     * This test is divided into 4 levels of increasing difficulty.
     *
     * You can have a look at the higher levels, but please do the simplest thing that could work for the level you're
     * currently solving.
     *
     * The levels become more complex over time, so you will probably have to re-use some code and adapt it to the new
     * requirements. A good way to solve this is to use OOP and add new layers of abstraction only when they become
     * necessary.
     * Don't hesitate to write shameless code at first and then refactor it in the next levels.
     *
     * HINTS
     * -----
     * CURRENT MONTH IS JUNE 2016.
     * All prices are in EUR.
     * Use Java 8 APIs (see: java.nio.file) to quickly read the file.
     * Use Gson (https://github.com/google/gson) to parse JSON file.
     * Don't use any other libraries.
     * `output.json` can be printed in the console or in a file.
     *
     * LEVEL 1
     * -------
     * Transactions are 'automagically' categorized by Bankin's API.
     * The user wants to know the total amount spent (or received) for very category for the current month (*June 2016*).
     *
     * OBJECTIVE
     * ---------
     * Write the code that generates output.json from input.json
